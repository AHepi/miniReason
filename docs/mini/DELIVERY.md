# Mini prototype — delivery

What was built, requirement by requirement, and the command that proves each.

Branch `claude/mini-prototype`. Nothing is merged; merging is the operator's
act.

## How to check any of this yourself

```sh
python3.12 tools/check.py bootstrap
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=src
python tools/check.py all                     # lint, the whole suite, pilots, citations
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -k mini   # the mini suite alone
```

The full suite is **642 tests, 0 failed** — 250 that were there before, 392
added here. No test calls a model.

`python tools/check.py all` is green at every commit on this branch **except
one**, named in the Amendment 2 section below and green again in the commit
after it.

### The conformance integration

`src/creib/forge/mini/conformance_kernels.py` registers four of the harness's
own functions as kernels over one reply text and thirteen rewrites as
transforms; `forge/mini/manifests/conformance-blind-spot/` carries a catalogue
of 25 rows drawn from `docs/kernel.md`, each with the input it was checked on,
and `test_conformance_integration` re-derives every row by executing the
harness's function through mini's registry. Four live runs on gemma4:31b, two
cycles each, are committed under `forge/mini/runs/conformance-blind-spot-gemma4-31b-1/`
to `-4/` and read in `FAILURE_MODES.md`; the first three were made before this
amendment and are the evidence for it.

## The audit of 2026-09-10

Six findings, all re-derived against the real package and all accepted. What was
done with each is in `docs/mini/AUDIT_RESPONSE.md`; the regressions are
`tests/mini/test_audit_findings.py` (23 tests), one class per finding:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_audit_findings.py
```

| Finding | What it was | State |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | An external kind file's format changes left the run identity unchanged | fixed |
| F2 | `commitment_ports` bypassed the read-permission preflight | fixed |
| F3 | A retry that succeeded was counted as one call | fixed |
| F4 | The live request contradicted the phase it was sent for | fixed |
| F5 | Attention could be offered work, including the verdict, after the verdict | fixed |
| F6 | A retry's recorded request was not the one that produced the reply; refused attempts' usage was dropped | fixed in part; the versioned attempt ledger stays proposed |

F4 also **withdraws an earlier report**. I described the first live run's
commitments-phase failures as a finding about the two-call shape being hard for
a model shown only prose. The model was in fact being told by its brief to
return one field and by its schema to return two. That reading was unfounded.

R37 corrects R35(b) **as I built it**, not as it was written. I fixed the
commitments call's exposure in code and gave a manifest no way to change it
short of turning the second call off — turning a default into a law, in a
prototype whose whole point is that every behaviour a run can vary is reachable
as configuration. The default is unchanged for anyone who declares nothing.

One commit on this branch was pushed with a red gate, and the commit after it
says so by name. I read the mini suite alone, saw it green, and did not re-read
the full suite after the last edit. Two test helpers had copied the migrated
script with `list(value)`, which on the new coordinate form yields the cycle
keys rather than the replies. Ten tests could not build their scripts. It was
green again in the next commit.

The blind-spot template can also be run and read by hand:

```sh
python tools/run_mini.py run --manifest forge/mini/manifests/blind-spot/manifest.json \
    --script forge/mini/scripts/blind-spot.json --output-dir /tmp/blind-spot
python tools/run_mini.py compare --root forge/mini/runs/blind-spot-stub --root /tmp/blind-spot
python tools/run_mini.py compare --root forge/mini/runs/blind-spot-stub --root /tmp/blind-spot --score   # refused
```

Every command above runs from the repository root with the environment of the
first section. `mini.<module>` works because `tests/mini/` is a package and
`tests` is on the path; equivalently
`python -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_formats.py`.

## The assumptions the table refers to

Four requirements are marked "built, with assumption". Each rests on one
reading of an open phrase, recorded in `DESIGN.md` §12 and overturnable by a
sentence:

- **A5 (R11)** — "failure rate" is read as three fields: `retries` (re-ask,
  error shown), then drop, with `tolerance` counting the drops the run permits
  and `action` saying what happens past it. All three actions the request names
  are reachable, and the default is "drop after one retry".
- **A8 (R13)** — "the same way it currently does" is read as typed events
  appended and never rewritten, replayed to rebuild state. The per-event hash
  chain is *added*; DeepReason's own log fences on sequence, not on a chain.
- **A9 (R16)** — a declared route replaces the default for the one kind or tier
  it names; everything else stays on the default pull.
- **A10 (R17)** — of "what its output may CHANGE", only `"nothing"` is
  implemented. Any other value is refused at compile rather than accepted and
  ignored.

The other eleven assumptions (A1–A4, A6, A7, A11–A15) sit under requirements the
table marks plainly "built", because the reading they take is the only one the
request's own words admit; they are listed in `DESIGN.md` §12 all the same.

### Amendment 2's assumptions

Twelve, in `DESIGN.md` §21–§28. The load-bearing ones:

- **C1 (R29)** — the two script forms are told apart by shape, not by a flag, so
  stages migrate one at a time. The blind-spot script migrates; the rest stay
  ordered.
- **C2 (R29)** — on the blind-spot template the demonstration policy finds
  nothing to prefer, so the two roots differ only in the run header. That is the
  result, and a second test on a manifest that does re-order shows what the
  ordered form could not do.
- **C6 (R32)** — only artifact ports raise the notice.
- **C7 (R35)** — what the second call's "nothing else" excludes, asserted as
  absence in the dispatched bytes rather than trusted from the construction.
- **C10 (R35)** — a machine seat makes one call and the record says
  `machine_single` rather than pretending a blind second call happened.
- **C11 (R35)** — the verdict-per-cycle rule binds every manifest, so the
  shipped examples are rebuilt. A structural rule the repository's own examples
  break is not a rule.

### Amendment 1's assumptions

Thirteen, in `DESIGN.md` §14–§19, and the load-bearing ones are these:

- **B1 (R22)** — a kind or tier may carry more than one route, since "a push is
  additive on top of whatever the route allows" has content only if a route and
  a push can coexist. `nowhere` may not be combined with anything.
- **B3 (R23)** — the budget cap counts model-seat calls including retries, and
  stops before a cycle rather than inside one.
- **B4 (R23)** — the cycle coordinate changed the record's shape, so the event
  record is now v2 and the v1 schema is kept and still read.
- **B7 (R23)** — `max_repeats` per stage is what bounds attention, so the
  record's stage count stays bounded by the manifest.
- **B8 (R25)** — a machine seat is resolved by kind id and returns exactly what
  a model would have returned, so the same format checks both.
- **B9 (R26)** — what a kernel function, a transform, a proposal and the
  catalogue are. The amendment defines none of them; this is the largest single
  interpretation in the build.
- **B10 (R26)** — the standing rule. **Written wrongly first**, and the run
  found it: it marked a pair the catalogue correctly lists as not moving, and
  that did not move, as a defect. A defect is now the catalogue and the
  execution disagreeing, in either direction. `DESIGN.md` keeps both versions.
- **B11 (R27)** — the script was not in the record, so a run now records a
  `responder_id`; that is what makes "asked the same way" checkable at all.
- **B13 (R27)** — never promote, stated for `compare`.

## What is proposed and not built

`SPEC.md`, Part three, is the full list and the honest paragraph on attention.
In one line each:

| Thing | Why it is not here |
|---|---|
| An attention policy worth trusting | the plug is built and one demonstration policy ships; nothing measures whether re-ordering helps, and nothing can run one plan two ways to find out |
| A standing an artifact can gain or lose | `changes: "nothing"` is the only implemented value; the slot and its refusal exist so the shape is visible |
| A command that pairs two runs | the record supports it — same plan and script give byte-identical logs — but no command does it |
| Cutting evidence by anything but blank lines | tables, lists and headings are cut as prose |
| A structured optional field on a kind | `optional_fields` admit strings, now offered in the brief and the live contract as well as admitted; structure goes in `commitments` under a JSON-schema format |
| Concurrency | one writer, one root, no lock; a second writer is detected on the next read, not prevented |

## Refusal sites

h-EPI's rule is that a new `raise` is a new refusal site and gets a test that
reaches it. There are 121 refusal sites in `src/creib/forge/mini/`; every one
has a negative test, and `tests/mini/test_refusals.py` exists for the sites the
requirement-shaped files do not already reach.

Whether the suite would in fact *notice* each one going quiet is a separate
question, and the repository's own instrument answers it:

```sh
git worktree add /tmp/mini-sweep HEAD
python tools/refusal_sweep.py --jobs 4 --report sweep.json \
    $(for f in src/creib/forge/mini/*.py; do echo --only $f; done)
```

The result of that run is in the "Sweep" section below.

## Live evidence

The offline delivery above stands on the scripted responder alone, and was
pushed before any model was called. The operator then supplied a key, so one
small live run was made through the default manifest, as the brief permits. It
is reported below as what the record shows and nothing more.

## Sweep

**Before Amendment 1**, over the 94 sites the first build had: **90 caught, 4
survived.** A survived site is one whose deletion the suite did not detect — the
guard may be unreached, or reached with its effect masked, or reached with an
effect no assertion looks at. All four were real gaps in my tests, not in the
code, and all four are named in the commit that fixed them:

- the unknown-refusal-code guard, which `assertRaises(RecordError)` passed
  either side of, because `MiniError` is a `RecordError`;
- the unwritable-blob path, which raised the wrong code — and the wrong name is
  why no test reached it;
- the unreadable-log path, caught one line later by the per-line reader instead;
- the root-must-be-a-path guard, whose deletion left the next line raising a
  `TypeError` of its own.

A confirming pass over those three files after the fixes: **24 of 24 caught, 0
survived.**

**After Amendment 1**, over all 115 sites: **113 caught, 2 survived** — the
`compare` root guard, masked by the next line raising a `TypeError` of its own,
and the event-version guard, which nothing reached at all. Both are fixed on
this branch and both were gaps in my tests rather than in the code.

**Amendment 2 has not been swept.** It adds refusal sites (the commitment-call
vocabulary, the three verdict-stage rules, the empty-port setting) and every one
has a negative test, but no sweep has yet asked whether those tests would
NOTICE the guard going quiet. The sweep takes about two hours. It should be run
before this branch is merged, and it has not been.

## Live run

One run, two calls, `gpt-oss:120b` through `https://ollama.com`, on the shipped
default manifest (conjecture, then criticism, then end) over one short supplied
source. The records are committed at
`forge/mini/runs/default-gpt-oss-120b/`.

```sh
export OLLAMA_API_KEY=…            # read at call time; in no file, no record, no log
python tools/run_mini.py live --manifest forge/mini/manifests/default/manifest.json \
    --model gpt-oss:120b --output-dir forge/mini/runs/default-gpt-oss-120b
python tools/run_mini.py replay --root forge/mini/runs/default-gpt-oss-120b
```

**What the record shows.** Seven events. The run entered `conjecture` and then
`criticism` in the declared order, produced one artifact at each, wrote no
format failure, no dropped submission and no refusal, and ended at the end stage.
Replaying the log alone reproduces the state digest the run reported. The source
cut into three blocks. No key appears anywhere under `forge/mini/runs/`
(`grep -ril "Bearer\|Authorization\|OLLAMA_API_KEY" forge/mini/runs/` prints
nothing).

**One finding, which is about the brief and not about the model.** Both
artifacts recorded **zero citations**, and both were in fact grounded. The model
put its block ids and its quotations inside the body prose — `[dcd587efbf…]
"A team measured a model's replies twice…"` — instead of in the `citations`
field the wire schema offered as optional. Extracting those prose claims by hand
and running them through the same `check_citations` used on the record verifies
all eleven of them: five in the conjecture, six in the criticism, every one
`MINI_CITATION_VERIFIED`.

So the citation channel recorded nothing while the artifacts were grounded. The
byte-check is not what failed; the brief is. What the record supports, and
nothing further: on this one run, with this model, this manifest and this
wording, the optional `citations` field went unused. It does not show that
models generally will not use it, and two calls could not show that.

**A second run, on a model the operator prefers to that one.** The same
manifest on `glm-5.3-flash`, three calls, at
`forge/mini/runs/default-glm-5.3-flash/`. Its conjecture stage returned an
unreadable reply twice, so the failure policy retried once, dropped the
submission and carried on to the criticism stage, which then ran with no
conjectures to criticise. Its criticism did use the `citations` field, and
filled it with three entries naming no block.

Those runs, and a third sent after the fix below, give four model-side or
brief-side findings and one defect in the harness, all registered with their run
roots in `docs/mini/FAILURE_MODES.md`.

The defect (H1) was mine: a reply refused for its format was not kept, only the
reason it was refused. It is fixed — every reply is stored before it is read —
and the fix paid for itself on the first run after it. The first refused reply
the record kept was not malformed at all: it was correct JSON inside a markdown
code fence (M4). With H1 open, that would have stayed on the record as
"unreadable" and nobody would have learned why.

**What these runs do not establish.** That the prototype works on anything
larger, that a repeat would return the same text, or that any artifact is any
good. Nothing here was compared with what the same model produces without the
harness, and neither run carries such an arm. Two models on one manifest behaved
oppositely on the same field; five calls cannot say which is typical.

## The experiments (Amendment 5)

Thirty live runs under `forge/mini/runs/experiments/`, in five rounds of five
and three addenda, each round pre-registered in
`forge/mini/manifests/experiments/README.md` before its records and read after.
What they corrected in mini is `FAILURE_MODES.md` M11 to M16; what they found in
the harness is `docs/failure-modes.md` H43 and `docs/kernel.md` P-09, P-10, R-03,
R-04 and G-09; `SPEC.md` §22 is the machinery, written from the code.

## Autonomy (Amendment 6)

`AUTONOMY.md` states what runs without a person and what does not. Running a
campaign of rounds unattended and refuting a written claim are both mechanical
and both now done; deciding that a disagreement nobody wrote down is a blind
spot is refused, for three independent reasons the document sets out, and the
useful remedy is to write each check's rule down once as a claim an execution
can contradict. The machinery is `SPEC.md` §23.
