"""Plural failure routing: every criticism names the loci that could be at fault.

The routing table below maps a trigger (a response verdict, a field verdict,
or a comparison outcome) to a set of live loci from the C/A/T/S vocabulary:

    CANDIDATE  the model under test
    AUXILIARY  prompt, format plumbing, instruction wording, harness settings
    TEST       the oracle, the corruption template, the probe design
    SCOPE      whether the case or endpoint is inside the declared scope

Table (trigger -> loci; family restrictions in brackets):

    TRANSPORT_ERROR            -> AUXILIARY, SCOPE
    EMPTY_RESPONSE             -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    TRUNCATED                  -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    INVALID_JSON               -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    NOT_AN_OBJECT              -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    REFUSAL_SUSPECTED          -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY, TEST
    PREREQUISITE_UNAVAILABLE   -> AUXILIARY, TEST
    EXTRA_FIELD                -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    MISSING_REQUIRED           -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY
    FORMAT_NOT_ENFORCED        -> TEST
    MISMATCH and constraint violations:
        default                -> CANDIDATE, TEST
        [RIVAL_SUBSTITUTION]   -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY, TEST
        [SEMANTIC_ROLE_TWIN]   -> CANDIDATE, TEST
        [SUBSTRATE_SWAP]       -> CANDIDATE, SCOPE, TEST
        [BOUNDARY_SHIFT]       -> CANDIDATE, TEST, SCOPE
        [ROUND_TRIP]           -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY, TEST
        [CYCLE]                -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY, TEST
    IDENTICAL_TO_BASELINE [NEGATION]        -> CANDIDATE, AUXILIARY, SCOPE
        (subsumes the field-level mismatch triggers of the same observation)
    CONTROL_ACCEPTED [NON_VACUITY]          -> TEST, AUXILIARY
    CONTROL_REJECTED [NON_VACUITY]          -> TEST
    DEPENDENCE_CHANGED [IMPORT_DEPENDENCY]  -> AUXILIARY, SCOPE
    DEPENDENCE_UNCHANGED [IMPORT_DEPENDENCY]-> AUXILIARY, TEST, SCOPE
    DEPENDENCE_CHANGED [UNIT_DEPENDENCE]    -> AUXILIARY, TEST, SCOPE
    DEPENDENCE_UNCHANGED [UNIT_DEPENDENCE]  -> AUXILIARY, TEST, SCOPE
    REPEAT_DIFFERS [REPEAT]                 -> AUXILIARY, CANDIDATE
    LENGTH_VIOLATION under active grounding -> adds AUXILIARY (the appended quotation
        instruction may have induced verbatim copying into a bounded value field)

A model-involved variant never routes to a single locus.  The only empty set
is a variant whose declared expectation was met everywhere; that is recorded
as ``unrefuted_for_variant`` and is not confirmation of anything.  The route
is always ``AWAITING_HUMAN_TRIAGE``.
