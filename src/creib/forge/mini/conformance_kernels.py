"""The conformance harness's own checks as mini kernels, and rewrites of a reply as transforms.

The blind-spot template asks a proposer for a kernel, a transform and an input,
runs the kernel before and after the transform by machine, and sets the result
against a catalogue of pairs already written down. This module points that loop
at the checks under ``src/creib/forge/conformance/`` rather than at mini's own:
every kernel here is one of the harness's functions read over one reply text,
and every transform is a rewrite of a reply of the kind the kernel table in
``docs/kernel.md`` describes (P-01 to P-08, R-01, R-02). Nothing in the
conformance package is changed or wrapped; the functions are called as they are.

A kernel is a function of one string, so only the checks that read a reply on
its own are here: JSON recovery, the parse verdict, whether recovery happened
from prose, and the refusal phrase. The grounding matcher reads a value beside a
span and is not a function of one string; it is not represented.

Importing this module registers the kernels and transforms. The registry is
listed, one entry per paragraph, in ``forge/mini/manifests/conformance-blind-spot/registry.txt``,
and a test refuses drift between that file and this module.
