"""Kernels a proposer names rather than a person registers (mini register M24).

A ``Kernel`` is a registered callable, so until now the boundary points a proposer could name were
exactly the ones somebody had written a ``register_kernel`` call for: ten at runtime. The space of
boundary points is not ten wide. This module lets a proposal name a function by its dotted path and
have it run, so what may be probed is bounded by an import rule that is written down rather than by
a list somebody curated.

Three bounds, declared rather than hidden:

- **The module allowlist.** Only the reading surface of the conformance harness. ``runner`` drives
  runs, ``executor`` calls an endpoint, ``common`` creates directories; a kernel is supposed to be a
  question about a reply, not an action, and this is the crudest honest way to say so. It is a
  bound, not a proof of purity: a function inside the allowlist may still do something surprising.
- **One argument.** ``Kernel.verdict`` is ``Callable[[str], str]``. A function of a variant, a key,
  two replies or a run's history cannot be reached this way, and that exclusion is the same one
  ``conformance_kernels`` already names.
- **A raise is unreadable, never a move.** Most of these functions raise on most inputs. Scoring an
  exception as an answer would make every crash look like a boundary point, and at this width there
  would be thousands. ``unreadable`` is what M11 already says to do with a verdict the check could
  not produce, and an execution with it on either side is ``unrunnable``.
