"""BUILD-TEST-1: does a proposer that must reconstruct produce what one that may relay does not?

The protocol is ``docs/mini/BUILD_TEST.md``, pre-registered before any arm ran. This module is
its machinery and decides nothing: it asks, it executes, it records.

*Explanatory Construction Semantics 2.0* §6.3 defines an originative act as
``Origin ⟺ Attempt ∧ New ∧ Build``. ``New`` is unestablishable for a model whose repertoire
before the event cannot be inspected (§6.2, the incomplete-archive case), so nothing here can
establish ``Origin`` and nothing here claims to. ``Build`` — "a nontrivial binding construction,
not a composition of content-preserving transfers" — is what two arms are separated on, by
§6.2's own phrase: learner reconstruction counts, relay does not.

Arm **R** is shown the checks' documented rules and no code. Arm **L** is shown the rules and the
complete source. Everything else is identical, the grid of MINI-USE-TEST-1 is gone (§8.3
condition 3), and no defect is seeded: a contradiction here is a place where this repository's
documentation and its behaviour disagree.
