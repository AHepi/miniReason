"""MINI-USE-TEST-1: the machinery for a comparison in which mini is allowed to lose.

The audit of 10 September asked for a decisive comparison and this repository owed it one. The
protocol (``docs/mini/USE_TEST.md``) puts five arms on the same hidden condition: a direct
audit, a tool-assisted adversary that may execute what it likes, mini's small core, full mini
with attention off, and full mini with attention on. Nothing here favours any of them.

Three pieces live here.

**A subject.** The code under test is a copy of the conformance harness's own reply-reading
functions, generated from their real source, so a seeded defect never touches this tree and the
functions are the ones the harness actually runs. A subject is a file; a mutation is a string
substitution in that file, recorded in a manifest a seat never sees.

**A frozen grammar with validators.** A cell of the recovery grid is a shape written in a
notation, and its validator compiles to predicates over the concrete text a seat built: one
fenced region, this much prose inside it, a distinct object after it. A cell counts as covered
only when a validator proves the executed text satisfies it — an assignment is a reservation
and an instantiation is a claim (the audit's F-A, its anti-cheating rule, and mini register
M12).

**A neutral packet.** Every arm ends in the same eight fields, with nothing in them that says
which arm or model produced it, so the adjudication can be blind.

Nothing in this module decides whether a claim is a defect. The sealed manifest is the truth
criterion for a seeded stratum, and it is opened after the packets are written.

#: The method version. The protocol forbids editing prompts, grids, validators or special cases
#: inside a registered block: a change makes a new method version and starts a new block.
#: Version 1 threw away a fenced packet, let a mini arm spend past the shared ceiling, and told a
#: proposer to remove a part from cells that have only one, so its first cells could not be
#: instantiated at all. Version 2 trusted the proposal's echo of the cell it had been given, so a
#: seat that copied the rendered port text instead of the cell failed validation for the
#: rendering's fault; version 3 takes the assigned cell from the assignment. Version 3 also
#: showed every mini proposer the documented rules and withheld the code, while arm A was given
#: both, so an arm difference could be read as an information difference; version 4 shows the
#: source to the proposer and the critic of arms C, D and E, keeps arm C-rules at the old
#: reading so the code's absence is measured on its own, and reserves each send's cost before
#: it is made instead of counting it afterwards. Version 4 then ran with the reasoning setting
#: off, because no cap small enough to walk twenty cells could hold this model's reasoning, and
#: the strongest arm lost its reproducer rather than its diagnosis (M17, and block 2's own
#: result); version 5 raises the per-call allowance until reasoning fits and turns it on. Every
#: break is recorded in ``docs/mini/USE_TEST.md``.
