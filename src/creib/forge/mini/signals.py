"""Signals: named quantities computed from the record, added by registration (R19).

A signal declares a name, a unit, and what it means; a function computes it from
state. Adding one is a registration, and nothing that consumes signals is
edited — an attention policy sees a new signal because it declares that it
reads it, never because a consumer learned about a subsystem.

Every shipped signal is keyed by an id the record already carries (a kind id, an
artifact id), so a kind nobody had invented when a signal was written still
appears in that signal's result.
