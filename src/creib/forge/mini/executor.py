"""The responder a stage is asked through.

Two ship. The scripted one calls nothing: it returns prepared replies in a
fixed order per stage, so a run of the same plan against the same script writes
the same record twice, and no test in this package needs a network or a key.
It is the only responder the suite uses.

The live one exists so a run can be driven by a real model. It does not speak
HTTP itself: it builds a request and hands it to the conformance harness's own
``OllamaChatExecutor``, which reads the key from ``OLLAMA_API_KEY`` at call
time, sends no auth material into any record, and redacts the key from any
error text. Reusing that executor rather than writing a second HTTP client is
deliberate: there is one place in this repository where a key is touched.
