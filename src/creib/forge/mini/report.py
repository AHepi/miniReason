"""Read a mini run root and say what it holds, deterministically and without a model.

Every round of the experiments needed the same reading: how many proposals a run got
through, how many the executor could run, which expectations the machine contradicted, which
cells of a grid were covered, and what the verdict seat committed. That reading was written by
hand each time, which put a person in the middle of a loop that has no other reason to stop.

Nothing here judges anything. It counts what the record says and lays the disagreements out
beside the texts that produced them; whether a disagreement is a blind spot is a reading a
person makes (``docs/mini/AUTONOMY.md``), and this module neither makes it nor pretends to.
