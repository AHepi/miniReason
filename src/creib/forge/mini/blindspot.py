"""The blind-spot template: hunting places a check does not see (R26).

The question it asks is this prototype's own: for each of its checks, is there a
rewrite of the input under which the check's verdict ought to move and does not,
or moves where nobody had written it down?

Three registries and one committed document:

- a KERNEL is a deterministic verdict of this prototype's own machinery over one
  piece of text;
- a TRANSFORM is a deterministic rewrite of one piece of text;
- the CATALOGUE lists the kernel and transform pairs already known, and whether
  each is known to move. It is supplied as an ordinary run source, so it is cut
  into blocks and a critic can cite it like any other evidence.

A proposal names a kernel, a transform and an input. The machine EXECUTOR runs
the kernel before and after the transform and records whether the verdict moved.
The machine VERDICT sets each execution against the catalogue and commits a
standing. Nothing in the loop promotes anything: a verdict is an artifact, it
mints no standing anywhere else, and a person turns the last one into boundary
points or does not.

    A kernel point in this repository has two columns, what the verdict moves
    under and what it does not, and each is shown on one input. The rule reads
    a catalogue row the same way:

    - A row that says the pair does NOT move is an invariance claim over every
      input of the class; one execution that moves refutes it, and that is a
      DEFECT in the catalogue. An execution that does not move agrees.
    - A row that says the pair MOVES is a sensitivity shown on the row's own
      input. An execution that moves agrees. One that does not move on the same
      input is a DEFECT, the row's own example being wrong; on another input
      it is a CANDIDATE POINT for the unchanged column, an input on which the
      check is blind to a rewrite it sees elsewhere.
    - An uncatalogued pair is a CANDIDATE POINT either way: for the moves
      column if it moved, for the unchanged column if it did not. The second
      is the blind spot nobody wrote down, which is what the loop is for.
    - A proposal that could not be run is REJECTED, and so is an agreement:
      neither adds a row.

    Until 10 September an uncatalogued non-movement was rejected and a
    catalogued pair was compared without regard to its input, so a proposal on
    a different input read as a defect where the catalogue and the code agree
    (the first live run of the conformance template).
