"""Warrant schema (spec §1, Def 3.4).

Both warrant types are contentful (packaged in artifacts); a bare verdict is
never an edge. Closure rule: any attacker of ``validity_node`` attacks the
warrant. Closure extension (case law): the nu of any rubric-derived warrant
must carry a mention ref to the standard it applied, and attackers of that
standard attack the nu (see adjudication/edges.py).
