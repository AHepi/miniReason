"""att/dep construction from interfaces (spec §1, §2).

- Each carried warrant => attack edge (carrier -> warrant.target).
- Each ``dependence`` ref => support edge (this -> target); dep must stay a
  DAG — a registration whose materialized edges would create a cycle is
  rejected (see harness).
- Validity-node closure: any attacker of a warrant's validity_node attacks
  the warrant — encoded as an attack on the warrant's carrier, which
  disables the carrier's attack edge in grounded semantics.
- Closure extension (case law, §1/§10.3): the nu of a rubric-derived warrant
  mentions the standard it applied; every registered attacker of that
  standard attacks the nu. Refute a standard => every nu citing it is
  attacked => every warrant under it falls => targets reinstate, all in
  pass 1.
- Evidence closure: a warrant validity node may declare ``evidence`` refs.
  Attackers of that evidence, or of any registered dependency beneath it,
  attack the validity node. The ordinary validity-node closure then disables
  every carrier of the warrant. Evidence invalidation therefore remains an
  explicit attack-graph derivation, never a hidden status check.

Edges materialize only when both endpoints are registered: refs/targets may
dangle (import/merge order, §14) and take effect when the target appears.
