"""Pass 2 — support cascade over the dep DAG (spec §4).

Process in topological order (dependencies before dependents). Refuting a
premise makes dependents ``suspended_unsupported``, NOT refuted — orphaned
!= false. Attacking a relation artifact refutes the relation while its
endpoints may stay accepted.
