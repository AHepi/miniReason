# Personal reasoning run

This is a personal working tool. Its output is a working answer with its objections, not a finding.

Run ID: `20260916T184015Z-04bf836ad4-578a4e`

Recipe: `cross-family`; SHA-256 `04bf836ad436d0458f543e61adbd5c9b8b6a3cfb96606f22633857e59a0a0494`.

Seats: `{"conjecture": {"endpoint": "deepseek-flash", "thinking": "native", "reasoning_effort": "medium"}, "critics": [{"endpoint": "ollama/qwen3.5-397b.native", "thinking": "off", "reasoning_effort": "medium"}, {"endpoint": "ollama/glm-5.3.native", "thinking": "off", "reasoning_effort": "medium"}], "use": {"endpoint": "ollama/qwen3.5-397b.native", "thinking": "off", "reasoning_effort": "medium"}, "rival": null}`

Requested cycles: 3; completed cycles: 0.

Recorded call attempts: 3; planned logical calls without early stop: 16. Includes one conditional closing return allowance. Completion allowance without repair/retry/fallback: 278528. Input tokens are additional and depend on problem and growing objection history.

Closing return enabled: True; outcome: not required. When enabled, one extra logical return follows cycle_budget if any use objection remains open; it supplies a final disposition for all open objections and preserves cycle_budget on success.

Wall per attempt: 300 seconds; explicit transport retries: 0.

Schema repair calls: 0; at most one per logical call. Repair transport errors are not retried; a native ceiling may use the declared fallback. Maximum attempts including repairs, fallbacks and configured transport retries: 37; maximum completion allowance: 720896.

Native-to-off ceiling fallback calls: 0; allowance: 5. Each allowed fallback keeps the same context and ceiling; failure ends that logical call. Under reasoning-exposure-v2, named critic/use failures are recorded as unavailable.

Unavailable critic seats: 0; Unavailable use seats: 0. Counts are logical seat occurrences across cycles, not failed attempts.

Declared ceilings and reasoning effort per seat (effort is sent only when the provider builder supports it):

Stop reason: `TRANSPORT_OR_RESPONSE_ERROR`.

Baseline outcomes: `{"bare": "TRANSPORT_OR_RESPONSE_ERROR", "native": "TRANSPORT_OR_RESPONSE_ERROR"}`.

Baselines run first; named ceiling, transport and schema failures are nonfatal under the saved resilience policy. Baseline outputs, when requested, are in BASELINE.md. Extra loop calls are not matched multi-call controls. No comparison is computed. Native support means locally implemented explicit control, not a fresh service capability check.

The use reader derives a dependent question separately from the problem and working answer; both derivations can be wrong. Review its exact request and response alongside returned objections. Original observations are in calls/. Custody checker: minireason.reason.prompts.parse (first JSON object with validated role fields); semantic use checker: the declared use seat. JSON validation checks custody fields only and does not decide the legitimacy of prose criticism.

Reported usage by attempt (null means unknown):
